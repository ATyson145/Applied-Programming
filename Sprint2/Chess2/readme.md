## Overview

**Project Title**:
Kotlin Chess Program
**Project Description**:
A chess program made in the Kotlin language. This program will use arrays in order
to make the chessboard and place the pieces on different parts of the board.
**Project Goals**:
Making a fully implemented chess game with most of the rules (perhaps not special rules
like castling) and allow for the program to be played with 2 people.
## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Go into the Main.kt file
2. Run the main function (as long as there are no errors)

Instructions for using the software:

1. Expand the terminal window to see the full board
2. Make note of which side of the board belongs to which player
3. Enter the location of the piece that you wish to move, then the location of where you
want that piece to be.

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:
