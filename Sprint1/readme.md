## Overview

**Project Title**:
Java Expense Tracker
**Project Description**:
A program which someone will be able to record their expenses while saving the date, the amount of money they spent and a description of 
what they spend their expenses on. 
**Project Goals**:
Get the java program to record the expenses that the user will make, as well as be able to view that expense in future uses of the program.
That will be done by making the Java program compatible with json files, in which the data the user records into the program will be 
saved therein.
## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Set up the Java language
2. Set up Gradle (this is for importing java json libraries)
3. Make a Java project in the Gradle setup

Instructions for using the software:

1. Run the program and look through the options.
2. Record expenses with the prompts the program will give you.
3. View expenses with the program in the second option.
