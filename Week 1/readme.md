1. Install Erlang and the rebar3 tool for erlang.
2. Create a new folder for the project.
3. While in the folder, open a new terminal and type "rebar3 new lib" in order to get the 
project set up.

Instructions for using the software:

1. Create the Erlang file with a -module, -export and a start statment that prints

2. In the terminal, type "erl" to start using Erlang
3. Type (name of module):start(). in order to print the statment found in the start statement.
4. Type halt(). in the terminal to end the program.
