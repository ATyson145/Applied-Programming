# CSE 310 - Hello World Module Report

Name: Adam Tyson

## Part 1 - Module Planning

On the first Monday of each Sprint, you will complete the planning section of the Module Report.  Topics include module selection and planning.  For the Hello World program, you will not fill in this section.

## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint. For the Hello World program, you will record your time from Week 1 here.

### Section 2.1 Time Log

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module (Hello World this week) or the team project.  Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting.  Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review).  You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.

|Date      |Start Time|IM or TP|Description                                 |Hours:Minutes|
|----------|----------|--------|--------------------------------------------|-------------|
| 4/27/24  |   3:15   |   IM   | Implementing code and learning syntax      |     1:12    |

## Part 3 - Module Results

This section should be filled out at the end of the Sprint and submitted.  For the Hello World program, you will complete this at the end of Week 1.

1. Put your GitHub link for your demonstration software here: 
    https://github.com/ATyson145/Applied-Programming/tree/main/Week%201
2. Put your YouTube link for your code walkthrough and demo video here:
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJMXmmiK-SE
3. Complete the following checklist by either indicating "Yes" or "No".  If you indicate "No" then provide an explanation of why.

|Question                                                    |Response|
|------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
|Are the links above public and working?                     |    Yes |
|Did you complete all the unique requirements for the module?|    Yes |
|Did you write at least 100 lines of code?                   | N/A    |
|Did you fully complete the readme.md file?                  |    Yes |
|Did you put the readme.md file in GitHub in the top folder? |    Yes |

4. In each Sprint, you will have the opportunity to complete an optional Stretch Challenge for bonus points.  You will normally report what you did here.  There is no Stretch Challenge for Hello World.

5. Using the log above, fill in the total hours and minutes you spent on the individual module:

|Activity         |Total Hours:Minutes|
|-----------------|-------------------|
|Individual Module|         1:12      |


6. What strategies (behavioral and technical) worked well during this Sprint?  What did not work well?  List some possible ways that you can improve next Sprint.
This 1 week sprint taught me that, though there are ways that this could have gone faster (such as choosings simpler language than Erlang),
learning what you don't know about a language can truly help you in the long run. I had to relearn a bit about erlang in order to create and finsih
this assignment. What worked well was going through tutorials in order to help find a solution to my issue. Exploring Erlang and all the tools that there are
to help write in Erlang gave me good insight into what I can do with it in the future. What didn't go well was my lack of understanding documentation. 
I know now that I need to focus a bit more time on understanding documentation for languages, allowing me to have access to better tips in the future.
