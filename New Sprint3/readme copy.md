## Overview

**Project Title**:
Adam Tyson Website Portfolio
**Project Description**:
A website portfolio that shows all the projects that I have worked on in the past, as well as my achievements and other things that
employers would like to see as I send this portfolio to others for internship opportunities.
**Project Goals**:
Creating a website with a few html pages that highlight my achievements while also demonstrating my ability to program while a visitor is on
my webpage. I would like to make unique-looking features to go onto my webpage (animations, games, something fun) that will woo anyone who sees
my portfolio.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Download Node.js
2. Download React
3. Create a React project in any IDE (I used VS Code because there are a lot of tutorials using VS Code)

Instructions for using the software:

1. Start by typing npm start into the terminal (starting up and hosting your website locally)
2. Type "Node server.js" in another terminal to run the background server for the contacts page.
3. Enjoy the animations.

## Development Environment

- Node.Js
