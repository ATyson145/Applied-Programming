## Overview

**Project Title**:
Adam Tyson Website Portfolio
**Project Description**:
A website portfolio that shows all the projects that I have worked on in the past, as well as my achievements and other things that
employers would like to see as I send this portfolio to others for internship opportunities.
**Project Goals**:
Creating a website with a few html pages that highlight my achievements while also demonstrating my ability to program while a visitor is on
my webpage. I would like to make unique-looking features to go onto my webpage (animations, games, something fun) that will woo anyone who sees
my portfolio.
