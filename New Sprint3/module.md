# CSE 310 - Module Report

Name: Adam Tyson

## Part 1 - Module Planning

This section should be filled on the first Monday of the Sprint and submitted

### Section 1.1 - Module Selection

1. What Sprint is this for (1-5)?
   Sprint 3
2. Select the Module (with a single X) that you will do this Sprint:

| Module                    | Selected Module |
| ------------------------- | --------------- |
| Cloud Databases           |                 |
| Data Analysis             |                 |
| Game Framework            |                 |
| GIS Mapping               |                 |
| Mobile App                |                 |
| Networking                |                 |
| SQL Relational Databases  |                 |
| Web Apps                  | X               |
| C++                       |                 |
| Java                      |                 |
| Kotlin                    |                 |
| Erlang                    |                 |
| TypeScript                |                 |
| Rust                      |                 |
| Choose Your Own Adventure |                 |

3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas. In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected. For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements. List the unique module requirements below:
   Write a web app using (this is my choice) - React with javascript. Must have at least two HTML pages populated by content determined by your code. However, if you use React, then you can
   keep to a single page with multiple interactions. Your software must be interactive meaning that the content displayed in your web app must be in some part based on user input. The web app
   must run on your local computer using the test server provided by your framework. If desired, you can host your web app on a cloud server.

### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module. Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below. You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material?
   w3schools, YouTube, React.dev

2. What is your plan to practice the new material? In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software?
   I plan on carefully studying the syntax and structure of the React language, as I have no experience in it whatsoever. I may even do a tutorial of something that has nothing to do
   with my project but helping me understand React better. I then plan on working on my own webpage bit by bit as I learn.

3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)?
   I plan on making a portfolio website.

4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.
   Everyday from 4-7 (at least when I am available). Locations: At home, STC, Library.

5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint. What is your mitgigation plan?
   A technical risk that I can foresee is my inability to correctly use React due to my inexperience with the language. I plan on learning React little by little, learning the syntax and
   structure while also doing what I can on my website as I learn, allowing me to practice as I learn at the same time. A behavioral risk I can see would be to procrastinate my learning. As
   learning a new langauge seems stressful to me (especially when I need a product by the end of a week and a half), I could falter and stop trying to learn while trying to make React work
   in the way that I want it to. My plan to mitigate this would be to ease my way into learning React little by little, following tutorials and learning syntax in order to learn, practice and
   reflect with every day that I work on the project. I believe that doing this will stop me from procrastinating and help me keep a consistent learning model that I can use.

## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint.

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project. Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting. Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review). You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.

| Date | Start Time | IM or TP | Description                     | Hours:Minutes |

## Part 3 - Module Results

This section should be filled out at the end of the Sprint and submitted.

1. Put your GitHub link for your demonstration software here:
   https://github.com/ATyson145/Applied-Programming/tree/main/New%20Sprint3

2. Put your YouTube link for your code walkthrough and demo video here:
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye0iRbUOsXc

3. Complete the following checklist by either indicating "Yes" or "No". If you indicate "No" then provide an explanation of why beneath the table.

| Question                                                     | Response |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| Are the links above public and working?                      | Yes      |
| Did you complete all the unique requirements for the module? | Yes      |
| Did you write at least 100 lines of code?                    | Yes      |
| Did you fully complete the readme.md file?                   | Yes      |
| Did you put the readme.md file in GitHub in the top folder?  | Yes      |

4. If you completed a Stretch Challenge (as shown in the Module Description document in Canvas) then describe what you did. If you did the Choose Your Own Adventure module, then you get to decide what qualifies as a Stretch Challenge.
   I don't know if it counts because I'm using React, but if it does, then the stretch challange that I think I made was adding more webpages onto
   my project (I technically have 4 in total).

5. Did you change your selected module during the middle of the Sprint? If yes, then describe what you changed it to, when you changed it, and why you changed it.
   I did not.

6. Using the log above, fill in the total hours and minutes you spent on the individual module:

| Activity          | Total Hours:Minutes |
| ----------------- | ------------------- |
| Individual Module | 10:08               |

7. What strategies (behavioral and technical) worked well during this Sprint? What did not work well? List some possible ways that you can improve next Sprint.
   I think the only strategy that really worked out for me this sprint was working on the project I was was learning React. Doing that helped
   me learn so much more about React, escpeically since I would be working on my project and, when I had questions, would then go and look to
   see how the next step in learning React would help me solve those issues. Things that did not work well for me this time around was keeping
   a consistent workflow going, as I have had a lot going on in all honesty. I think the best way for me to tackle that kind of issue next time
   would be to set a good time each day to just sit down and learn the material that I need to go through while working on my project. A little bit at
   a time helps.
