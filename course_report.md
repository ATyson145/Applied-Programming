# CSE 310 - Course Report

Name: Adam Tyson

## Part 1 - Semester Planning

This section should be filled out during Week 1 and submitted.

### Section 1.1 - Module Planning

During this course you get to decide what technologies and languages you want to learn. After looking at the Module Description document in Canvas, select 5 modules that interest you. You will be responsible for learning the material and creating software to demonstrate what you learned. The software that you write will be placed in your personal software portfolio. You can change you mind later in the course based on your experiences. Try to select modules that stretch your current abilities.

You will work on one module in every 2 week Sprint. During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module. Mark only one "X" in each of the five columns. The "Choose Your Own Adventure" can only be selected starting in Sprint 3.

### Section 1.2 - Goal Setting

Every Sprint you will be setting a goal to improve one of your learning skills. Learning technology is fun. However, we don't want to neglect learning how to learn better. Your ability to use new technology and handle difficult situations will improve as you give attention to your learning skills.

1. Complete the following Learning Skill Survey:

| Learning Skill Survey (3=Frequently, 2=Sometimes, 1=Rarely |             |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| **Time Management Skills**                                 | **Ranking** |
| I use multiple sources of information.                     | 2           |
| I document what I am learning.                             | 1           |
| I prepare well-thought-out questions.                      | 2           |
| I experiement and make observations.                       | 1           |
| I share what I am learning with others.                    | 1           |
| **Time Management Skills**                                 | **Ranking** |
| I manage my time between all my responsibilities.          | 3           |
| I estimate task duration based on prevoius work.           | 3           |
| I create a schedule for all assignments and projects.      | 2           |
| **Risk Management Skills**                                 | **Ranking** |
| I always start with identifying what I do not know.        | 2           |
| I identify what could fail based on previous experiences.  | 3           |
| I create mitigation plans for risks.                       | 2           |
| **Continuous Improvement Skills**                          | **Ranking** |
| I honestly identify the mistakes I have made in my work.   | 2           |
| I develop improvement plans for future work.               | 1           |
| I am motivated by goals and vision (growth mindset).       | 1           |

2. Based on your resonses in the survey above, pick one area that you want to improve. Write a "Small and Simple" goal to improve in this area throughout the semester. Write your goal below:
   I would like to work on the continuous improvement skills area, as I am pretty bad at keeping my goals and ideas as a continuing growth experience. I want to change this in order to better my relationship with learning and failing. To help with this, I think documentation of what I am doing will help me continue to learn. I would review that documentation daily, investigating where I need to focus on and making a plan that day on what I need to learn to grow. Growth on this goal would be found in just doing it every day.

## Part 2 - Semester Conclusion

This section should be filled out during Week 14 and submitted.

After a long semester of learning new things, its good to pause and consider what you experienced. You learned many new technologies and languages on your own. You have the capability to continue to do this outside of school. Sprint 6 and beyond is in your hands.

1. As you have worked individually and as a team to develop your personal software portfolio, how have your technical skills improved?
   My technical skills have improved in various ways, but the two that stand out to me the most are 1. My ability to keep code in an order that makes sense for a project and 2. My ability to learn new material in a quick manner. For the first one, I had a lot of opportunities from either my own projects or the team project to clean up my code and make it so the code was readable to others that had to work on it/observe how the code works. From all of that practice I am getting better at just making sure the design of the program takes precedent, allowing me to not reuse code and keep it organized. For the second one, I am getting way better at looking at languages and just getting down into programming after about a couple of hours. The more experience I have with languages the more I see the similarites in all of them, which is now giving me the ability to work on any language (given some time to learn the basics).

2. Identify at least one technology or language you learned this semester that you want to continue to improve after this course. What is your next step?
   I want and need to learn more about Erlang after this course. I really appreciated how Erlang can be used for concurrency, allowing programs to execute in a quicker way. The next step for this langauge is to grab a book/tutorial (as there are not many readily available online/on YouTube) and just learn more about Erlang's syntax and more about concurrency within the language.

3. Look back at the goal you wrote at the beginning of the semester (Part 1 above). What was the result of your goal? Did your goal change during the semester? What do you want to work on next to improve your ability to learn?
   So I did not fulfill my goal as I had hoped, but there are times where I did document my progress and thought about what I had done in my projects to better help me understand where I can do better. Though that part of the goal was not done properly, I was able to better instill a growth mindset within myself, as working on various projects in different languages helped me realize that I can learn how to do these things, and that given time to learn the material, I can begin to program bigger projects that solve real world problems.
   As I go on learning outside of this class, I think the next step that I need to take in making sure I learn the best that I can would be to rely less on the help of the internet and just try and fail on my own. The more I fail, the more I can learn from those failures and push myself to be a better thinker and programmer.
