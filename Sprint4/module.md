# CSE 310 - Module Report

Name: Adam Tyson

## Part 1 - Module Planning

This section should be filled on the first Monday of the Sprint and submitted

### Section 1.1 - Module Selection

1. What Sprint is this for (1-5)?
   Sprint 4

2. Select the Module (with a single X) that you will do this Sprint:

| Module                    | Selected Module |
| ------------------------- | --------------- |
| Cloud Databases           |                 |
| Data Analysis             |                 |
| Game Framework            | X               |
| GIS Mapping               |                 |
| Mobile App                |                 |
| Networking                |                 |
| SQL Relational Databases  |                 |
| Web Apps                  |                 |
| C++                       |                 |
| Java                      |                 |
| Kotlin                    |                 |
| Erlang                    |                 |
| TypeScript                |                 |
| Rust                      |                 |
| Choose Your Own Adventure |                 |

3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas. In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected. For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements. List the unique module requirements below:
   The game must display graphics, the game must take user input from the keyboard or
   mouse, and the game must have moveable objects.

### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module. Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below. You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material?
   w3schools, YouTube, Pygame.org or Pygame-zero.org
2. What is your plan to practice the new material? In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software?
   I plan on working on a tutorial that I have found regarding the game I want to
   make,then updating the game with my own ideas after I have gotten a hang of using
   Pygame (perhaps I will go through a couple tutorials to help my understanding).
3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)?
   I plan on making a Pong clone, however, I wish for there to be different actions
   in the middle that change the game and make it more fun for players.
4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.
   Everyday from 2-4 or 6-8. I will work in the STC and at home.
5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint. What is your mitgigation plan?
   The only technical risk that I can see happening is that the programs that I am
   using have bugs that will stop me from completing the game I want to make (If I
   were to use Arcade, that is). To stop that, I plan on studying the different game
   framworks that are in Python and pick the one that is best suited for my needs
   (and perhaps the best one technically). A behavioral risk I can see causing an
   issue is to consistently work on the project instead of all at once. To help with
   that, I plan on working on it every day until the project is finished, then
   studying after if I don't have the time put in (or working on more changes if I
   can come up with some).

## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint.

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project. Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting. Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review). You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.

## Part 3 - Module Results

This section should be filled out at the end of the Sprint and submitted.

1. Put your GitHub link for your demonstration software here:
   https://github.com/ATyson145/Applied-Programming/tree/main/Sprint4

2. Put your YouTube link for your code walkthrough and demo video here:
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Yfro9NXm7g
3. Complete the following checklist by either indicating "Yes" or "No". If you indicate "No" then provide an explanation of why beneath the table.

| Question                                                     | Response |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| Are the links above public and working?                      | Yes      |
| Did you complete all the unique requirements for the module? | Yes      |
| Did you write at least 100 lines of code?                    | Yes      |
| Did you fully complete the readme.md file?                   | Yes      |
| Did you put the readme.md file in GitHub in the top folder?  | Yes      |

4. If you completed a Stretch Challenge (as shown in the Module Description document in Canvas) then describe what you did. If you did the Choose Your Own Adventure module, then you get to decide what qualifies as a Stretch Challenge.
   I added a sounds and background music into the program.
5. Did you change your selected module during the middle of the Sprint? If yes, then describe what you changed it to, when you changed it, and why you changed it.
   No.
6. Using the log above, fill in the total hours and minutes you spent on the individual module:

| Activity          | Total Hours:Minutes |
| ----------------- | ------------------- |
| Individual Module | 10:06               |

7. What strategies (behavioral and technical) worked well during this Sprint? What did not work well? List some possible ways that you can improve next Sprint.
   The best strategy that I had was just letting me work as long as I wanted to while I had extra time. I flew by this project during the beginning of this sprint and it was because
   I pushed myself to use the extra time that I had to build this project. The flaw of this strategy, however, is that when I felt that I didn't have much time for the project, I wouldn't
   do it, pushing it off to the side until I felt that I had more time. A way to improve this would be to keep a consistent schedule, allowing me to work every day, while also keep working
   while I do have extra time on my hands.
