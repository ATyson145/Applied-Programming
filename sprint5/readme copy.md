## Overview

**Project Title**:
Sudoku Solver
**Project Description**:
A Sudoku Solver made in Erlang
**Project Goals**:
I plan on making it so that the program solves sudoku puzzles that either the program generates or that the user provides.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Make sure to be inside the src folder of this project before starting.
2. Type erl into the terminal
3. Access the sudoku program by typing c(sudoku).

Instructions for using the software:

1. When in the program, you can either generate a new sudoku board and insert values one at a time, or you can type a string
   into the erl shell and have the solve function solve the line of numbers.
2. Make sure when you are typing the string that you start at the upper left corner of the puzzle, then type as though
   you were reading a book (from left to right, down a line when you reach the end). There should be 81 numbers in total.
3. Use the solve function to print out a visual of the completed sudoku puzzle.

## Development Environment

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

- Download Erlang (either on their website or using another tool (I used homebrew))
- Download Visual Studio Code

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

- [ ] I want to add a GUI that helps make the suduko input faster for the user.
- [ ] I want to make the solver into a game, having the solver as a bonus for the user to use when they get stuck.
- [ ] I wast to improve the performance of harder puzzles for the program.
