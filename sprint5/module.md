Name: Adam Tyson

## Part 1 - Module Planning

This section should be filled on the first Monday of the Sprint and submitted

### Section 1.1 - Module Selection

1. What Sprint is this for (1-5)?
   5
2. Select the Module (with a single X) that you will do this Sprint:

| Module                    | Selected Module |
| ------------------------- | --------------- |
| Cloud Databases           |                 |
| Data Analysis             |                 |
| Game Framework            |                 |
| GIS Mapping               |                 |
| Mobile App                |                 |
| Networking                |                 |
| SQL Relational Databases  |                 |
| Web Apps                  |                 |
| C++                       |                 |
| Java                      |                 |
| Kotlin                    |                 |
| Erlang                    | X               |
| TypeScript                |                 |
| Rust                      |                 |
| Choose Your Own Adventure |                 |

3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas. In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected. For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements. List the unique module requirements below:
   Display output to the screen using format, pattern matching in function parameters, recursion, guards, lists, and using lambda functions with
   lists:map, lists:filter, or lists:foldl.

### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module. Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below. You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material?
   w3schools, YouTube, chatGPT, erlang.org
2. What is your plan to practice the new material? In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software?
   I plan on studying in detail how the langauge works, especially since this language is one that I will need to learn a lot more of for the following
   semester. Half of my time will probably be spent on studying how the language works, with the other half used to complete the project.
3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)?
   I plan on making a sudoku solver.
4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.
   Monday to Saturday from 6-7PM, at the STC or at my home office.
5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint. What is your mitgigation plan?
   A technical risk I can forsee is that I do not have the proper tools updated to support the language at the momeent, meaning I will have to spend
   some time to update and learn the new tools that support Erlang. A behavioral risk I forsee is that I will get frustrated from learning this new
   language, especially as the semester continues to ramp up and I have to try and divide my time more and more. I personally love to spend good chunks of
   time getting to work on my projects, so splitting up my time will be a new challange I will have to adapt to.

## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint.

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project. Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting. Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review). You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.

## Part 3 - Module Results

This section should be filled out at the end of the Sprint and submitted.

1. Put your GitHub link for your demonstration software here:
   https://github.com/ATyson145/Applied-Programming/tree/main/sprint5
2. Put your YouTube link for your code walkthrough and demo video here:
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJenJ1dGeQE
3. Complete the following checklist by either indicating "Yes" or "No". If you indicate "No" then provide an explanation of why beneath the table.

| Question                                                     | Response |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| Are the links above public and working?                      | Yes      |
| Did you complete all the unique requirements for the module? | Yes      |
| Did you write at least 100 lines of code?                    | Yes      |
| Did you fully complete the readme.md file?                   | Yes      |
| Did you put the readme.md file in GitHub in the top folder?  | Yes      |

4. If you completed a Stretch Challenge (as shown in the Module Description document in Canvas) then describe what you did. If you did the Choose Your Own Adventure module, then you get to decide what qualifies as a Stretch Challenge.
   I did not.

5. Did you change your selected module during the middle of the Sprint? If yes, then describe what you changed it to, when you changed it, and why you changed it.
   No.

6. Using the log above, fill in the total hours and minutes you spent on the individual module:

| Activity          | Total Hours:Minutes |
| ----------------- | ------------------- |
| Individual Module | 10:07               |

7. What strategies (behavioral and technical) worked well during this Sprint? What did not work well? List some possible ways that you can improve next Sprint.
   What worked well for me was keeping a consistent study and work schedule (and by that, I mean study Erlang then work on the project). I made two
   different schedules to help me learn and work at the same time, helping me get parts of the project done in a consistent and good timeline. This helped
   me in both a technical sense and behavioral (since it kept me motivated to work on my time). The only thing that didn't work all that well was
   saving files in Erlang, which for some reason has an issue of adding back in lines I deleted while I was working on the document.
